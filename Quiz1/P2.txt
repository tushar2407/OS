Errors and exceptions encountered:
  

1. problem2.c:1:1: warning: return type defaults to ‘int’ [-Wimplicit-int]
add(float a, float b){

    - The above warning was encountered as no return type was mentioned during the function definition of add(). To which the compiler by default assigns ‘int’ as the return type.
    
2. problem2.c: In function ‘add’:
problem2.c:2:20: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘round’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
         return (float)(round(a)+round(b));
problem2.c:2:20: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘round’
problem2.c:2:20: note: include ‘<math.h>’ or provide a declaration of ‘round’


    - The above warning occurred as the function ‘round’ was used without its declaration and definition. 
    - ‘round()’ being a function present in the ‘math.h’ header file, the compiler suggests to either import that header file or to include a function definition for ‘round’ so as to instruct it what to do when the program calls it.
