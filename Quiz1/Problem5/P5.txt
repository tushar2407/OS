Answer :  Real mode

Justification:

According to me, there is no correct answer to the given question.
Using real mode or long mode totally depends on the need of 
the programmer and the user.
If the computational power is the main priority, then use
long mode for running the assmebly program, else use real
mode if you want to fit a large program into the RAM during runtime, 
which will affect the running time of your code.
Secondly, real mode is faster as compared to long mode. 
Moreover, in real mode, 32bit and 64bit registers also accessible, 
so that gives it an upper hand over long mode.
