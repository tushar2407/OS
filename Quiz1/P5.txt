Suppose you have an x86-64 processor in an embedded system with only 320KB
of RAM. Then, would you ever use the long mode (64-bit mode) or would you
prefer to use real mode (16-bit mode) 
for running your program. Please justify
your answer.

A5. 
With x86-64 processor embedded in my system, 
memory of RAM won’t affect the mode I choose 
for running my program as the registers that 
I will use in 16-bit mode will just be 64-bit 
registers rather wasting the a lot of memory 
during the program run. As 16-bit registers 
are nothing but the least significant 16-bits 
of a 64-bit register in x86-64 processor. Using 
16-bit mode instead of 64-bit won’t supply me 
with any extra registers, the number remains 
the same, and the amount of memory the occupy 
also remains just the same.
